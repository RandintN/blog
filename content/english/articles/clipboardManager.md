The best productivity tool for using a computer is a clipboard manager, a program that **locally stores** everything you copy with control + c.

### The Problem
The clipboard is an essential tool for any computer user. It allows you to copy and paste text, images, and other data from one application to another. However, the clipboard has a limitation: it can only store one thing at a time.

This can be a problem if you're working on a project that requires copying multiple items from the clipboard. For example, if you're writing an article and need to copy a block of text from a website, an image from a document, and a link from a web page, you'll need to paste each item one at a time. This can be a time-consuming and frustrating process.

### The Solution
One way to solve this problem is by using a clipboard manager. A clipboard manager is a tool that stores all the items you copy to the clipboard. This means you can copy as many items as you want and paste them whenever you want.

There are many clipboard managers available, but one of the most popular ones is Ditto. Ditto is a free and open-source clipboard manager that is easy to use. It allows you to store up to 100 items on the clipboard, and you can organize items into folders.

Here are some advantages of using a clipboard manager:

### The Tool
If you're looking for a way to enhance your productivity when using a computer, a clipboard manager is a great option. Ditto is an excellent tool to start with because it's free, easy to use, and offers many features.
