My life motto is: _Standing on the shoulders of giants._

This proverb is often attributed to Isaac Newton and suggests that any success or knowledge we achieve in life is largely due to the people who came before us.

This is a central idea for me, highlighting true humility, appreciation, and respect for the knowledge and accomplishments of others.

I recognize that my achievements are the result of the foundations laid by those who came before me, allowing me to see further and achieve even more.

This phrase also reflects my ongoing pursuit of knowledge, as I am always willing to learn from others and build upon existing knowledge.

I am also an experienced Software Engineer and lover of philosophy, especially the classics.

I can speak Portuguese, English, and Japanese, and I study Latin and Ancient Greek.

I have a diverse career that covers multiple fields of specialization because I don't like to be alienated and work/do just one thing.

My personality type is INTJ-A.
